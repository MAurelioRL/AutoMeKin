AutoMeKin (formerly known as tsscds) is a computer program that has been designed to discover reaction mechanisms and solve the kinetics in an automated fashion. AutoMeKin obtains transition state guess structures from trajectory simulations of the highly vibrationally excited species. From the obtained TS structures, minima and product fragments are determined following the intrinsic reaction coordinate. Finally, having determined the stationary points, the reaction network is constructed and the kinetics is solved. The program is interfaced with MOPAC2016 and Gaussian 09 (G09).

A computer program for finding reaction mechanisms and solving the kinetics.
